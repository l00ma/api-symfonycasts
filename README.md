A very interesting and enriching training about using APIs with Symfony:
[https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform)

I couldn't use the "start" project offered for download by SymfonyCasts, so I started from scratch with Symfony 6.3 and API Platform 3.
